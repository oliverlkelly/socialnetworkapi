# Social Network API

## Task
To create a fun ctional social network api.

## Outcomes
This project allowed me to learn more about the following;
- Javascript implimentation and use
- Express implimentation and use
- The ability to take a set of criteria and create a functional API that follows those criteria
- The use of API's and handling their data
- A deeper understanding of Javascript and it things you can do with it
- A deeper understanding of MongoDB and using Express to manipulate a database

## Installation

This project can be run on the local environment by cloning the codebase and running the server.js file. It is setup to connect to a local database, or a .env can be employed.

## Usage

This codebase is a functional API that can create and manipulate "users", adding friends, thoughts and reactions. It can be used with an app like Insomia to perform the calls on the given seed data, which is itself randomised.

## Credits
